### Introduction
The **AsyncLazyDictionary** is a powerful tool for managing data in a multithreaded environment. By combining the concepts of lazily initializing values and asynchronous programming, this dictionary offers a flexible and efficient solution for your .NET applications.

### How to Use
To get started with the **AsyncLazyDictionary**, simply include the appropriate namespace in your C# code:

```csharp
using Soenneker.Dictionaries.AsyncLazy;
```

Next, create an instance of the **AsyncLazyDictionary** class:

```csharp
var asyncLazyDictionary = new AsyncLazyDictionary<TKey, TValue>();
```

Now you can start populating the dictionary with key-value pairs. The values will be initialized lazily and asynchronously, ensuring optimal performance and resource utilization.

```csharp
asyncLazyDictionary.Add(key, async () => await GetValueAsync(key));
```

### Benefits
üîπ **Thread-Safe**: The **AsyncLazyDictionary** is designed to be thread-safe, allowing multiple threads to access and modify the dictionary concurrently without the risk of data corruption.

üîπ **Lazy Initialization**: Values in the dictionary are only initialized when they are accessed for the first time, improving memory usage and startup performance.

üîπ **Asynchronous Operations**: By supporting asynchronous initialization of values, the dictionary can handle time-consuming tasks without blocking the calling thread.

### Examples
Here are some examples demonstrating how to use the **AsyncLazyDictionary** in various scenarios:

#### Example 1: Lazy Loading of Configuration Settings
```csharp
var configDictionary = new AsyncLazyDictionary<string, string>();

var settingValue = await configDictionary.GetOrAddAsync("settingKey", async () => await LoadSettingAsync("settingKey"));
```

#### Example 2: Caching External API Responses
```csharp
var apiCache = new AsyncLazyDictionary<string, ApiResponse>();

var response = await apiCache.GetOrAddAsync("apiEndpoint", async () => await CallApiAsync("apiEndpoint"));
```

### Contributions
